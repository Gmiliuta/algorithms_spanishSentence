## 2. Challenge

#### Background

In Spanish, sentences not only end with exclamation and question marks, but also begin with them (actually flipped over version).

It looks like:
Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s?      -> How are you?
Â¡Es maravilloso!  -> It is wonderful!

#### Task

Keeping in mind the above-mentioned fact, your task is to find out how many sentences in unput array are spanish and spanish wannabes and return 'Â¡(n) spanish sentence(s)!'
If input is not an array you have to return 'Give me arrays only! Por favor!'

### 2.1. Examples

```js
spanishSentence(['How are you?', 'Â¿How are you?',  'It is you', 'Â¡It is you', 'Â¡You are awesome!']) // should return 'Â¡2 spanish sentences here!'
spanishSentence(['How are you?', 'Â¡Es maravilloso!',  'It is you', 'Â¡Es maravilloso!', 'Â¡You are awesome!']) // // should return 'Â¡2 spanish sentences here!'
spanishSentence(undefined) //should 'Give me arrays only! Por favor!'
